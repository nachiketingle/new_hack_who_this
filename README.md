# Telepic

A telephone game based on drawings.

## What is it?

An mobile game in which you play a telephone and pictionary mashup! Pick a random word, and create a sketch. The sketch will get passed on to the next person, and they have to make a sketch based off of that. The last person will then have to guess the word that the sketch is based off of. Loads of fun guessing and seeing each others drawing! Draw together you friends and family with Telepic!

## What branch to use?

Do not use the master branch. All it has is a starter Flutter project. The mobileDev branch has all the code for the mobile app. The backend branch has the code for the server.
